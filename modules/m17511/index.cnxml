      <title>CLINICS, FESTIVALS, AND CONTESTS</title>
      <para id="id3947881">Clinics, festivals, and contests are held in every state and can be valuable activities in a choral department. None of these events by themselves can provide a complete choral program, but any or all of them can supplement a well-rounded program. Each of these activities can be a valuable part of a choral program if used carefully and effectively, but no one activity should become the peak of the department's goals. Rather than having one point on which the efforts of the students and the director are focused, the choral year should have several peaks of activity, all important, all enjoyed to the fullest. No one activity is more important than any other, but is a direct complement to the others, contributing to the growth of the choral department and receiving strength from the other activities. When this is the case, each student in the department will have at least one activity that he will find the most enjoyable. Since every student will not enjoy the same things, several activities will best meet the interests of all students.</para>
      <para id="id3947885">The terms clinics, festivals, and contests are used interchangeably throughout the country. Each term will be defined before its discussion in another module devoted to that subject.</para>
