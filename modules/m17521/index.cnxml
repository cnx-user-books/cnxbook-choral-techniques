      <title>CONTESTS</title>
      <para id="id4409259">Contests refer to situations where either large choral ensembles, small vocal ensembles, or soloists compete against each other, or against a standard of excellence for a rating. Usually a written critique is given and occasionally a verbal critique as well. Most often the judges are rating the ensembles or soloists against an unwritten standard, which means that more than one ensemble may receive a superior rating. There are some contests, usually private contests, that also give an outstanding choir award, runner-up award, etc.</para>
      <para id="id4339881">Music contests vary from state to state. Some states have area or district contests, then a regional contest, and finally a state contest. Some states have only regional and state contests while still others have only a state contest. One set of guidelines will not fit all the various programs in our country. The discussion that follows concerning preparation is directed at a polished performance in the final contest. This should be a director's goal whether participating in a district contest or a series of contests.</para>
      <para id="id4126435">There are also large privately sponsored choral contests that attract choirs from several states. Sometimes these contests place choirs in categories by size of school and by the rating the choir received in its own state association contest. For example, choirs receiving Division I ratings in state association contests would compete against each other, and the outstanding choir of this contest would be chosen from this group. Sometimes these contests offer money as a prize to the top-rated choirs. Since some states prohibit their schools from accepting prize money, it is best to know your state governing association rules on such matters before entering. If necessary, you can exclude prize money on the application blank as you enter.</para>

        <title>CONTEST PROS AND CONS</title>
        <para id="id4927199">Music contests and their value have been a subject of discussion for some years in music education. This is a highly explosive subject and those on both sides of the coin are equally sure they are right. If one intends to remain in music education, one will certainly become involved in a discussion of contests at one time or another, perhaps with an administration or a board of education. It is best to be familiar with both sides of the coin, whatever one's personal views are or become. Listed below are some of the arguments most often made for and against contest.</para>
